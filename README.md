# What is Redis Sentinel?

> Redis Sentinel provides high availability for Redis. In practical terms this means that using Sentinel you can create a Redis deployment that resists without human intervention to certain kind of failures.
> 
> Redis Sentinel also provides other collateral tasks such as monitoring, notifications and acts as a configuration provider for clients.

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# How to deploy Redis Sentinel in Kubernetes?

You can find an example for testing in the file `test.yaml`. To launch this sample file run:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f test.yaml
```

> NOTE: If you are pulling from a private containers registry, replace the image name with the full URL to the docker image. E.g.
>
> - image: 'your-registry/image-name:your-version'

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

> NOTE: Debian 8 images have been deprecated in favor of Debian 9 images. Bitnami will not longer publish new Docker images based on Debian 8.

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Redis Sentinel Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis-sentinel).

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/redis-sentinel:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis-sentinel/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/redis-sentinel:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
$ docker build -t bitnami/redis-sentinel:latest https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-redis-sentinel.git
```

# Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a Redis server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers.

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

## Using the Command Line

In this example, we will create a Redis Sentinel instance that will monitor a Redis instance that is running on the same docker network.

### Step 1: Create a network

```bash
$ docker network create app-tier --driver bridge
```

### Step 2: Launch the Redis instance

Use the `--network app-tier` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the Redis container to the `app-tier` network.

```bash
$ docker run -d --name redis-server \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    --network app-tier \
    bitnami/redis:latest
```

### Step 3: Launch your Redis Sentinel instance

Finally we create a new container instance to launch the Redis client and connect to the server created in the previous step:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm \
    -e REDIS_MASTER_HOST=redis \
    --network app-tier \
    bitnami/redis-sentinel:latest
```

## Using Docker Compose

When not specified, Docker Compose automatically sets up a new network and attaches all deployed services to that network. However, we will explicitly define a new `bridge` network named `app-tier`. In this example we assume that you want to connect to the Redis server from your own custom application image which is identified in the following snippet by the service name `myapp`.

```yaml
version: '2'

networks:
  app-tier:
    driver: bridge

services:
  redis:
    image: 'bitnami/redis:latest'
    environment:
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    networks:
      - app-tier
  redis-sentinel:
    image: 'bitnami/redis-sentinel:latest'
    environment:
      - REDIS_MASTER_HOST=redis
    ports:
      - '26379:26379'
    networks:
      - app-tier
```

Launch the containers using:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

# Configuration

## Configuration file

The image looks for configurations in `/bitnami/redis-sentinel/conf/`. You can mount a volume at `/bitnami` and copy/edit the configurations in the `/path/to/redis-persistence/redis/conf/`. The default configurations will be populated to the `conf/` directory if it's empty.

### Step 1: Run the Redis Sentinel image

Run the Redis Sentinel image, mounting a directory from your host.

```bash
$ docker run --name redis-sentinel \
    -e REDIS_MASTER_HOST=redis \
    -v /path/to/redis-sentinel/persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/redis-sentinel:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  redis-sentinel:
    image: 'bitnami/redis-sentinel:latest'
    environment:
      - REDIS_MASTER_HOST=redis
    ports:
      - '26379:26379'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/redis-persistence:/bitnami
```

### Step 2: Edit the configuration

Edit the configuration on your host using your favorite editor.

```bash
$ vi /path/to/redis-persistence/redis/conf/redis.conf
```

### Step 3: Restart Redis

After changing the configuration, restart your Redis container for changes to take effect.

```bash
$ docker restart redis
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose restart redis
```

Refer to the [Redis configuration](http://redis.io/topics/config) manual for the complete list of configuration options.

# Logging

The Bitnami Redis Sentinel Docker Image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. To view the logs:

```bash
$ docker logs redis
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose logs redis
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Redis Sentinel, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/redis-sentinel:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to
`bitnami/redis-sentinel:latest`.

### Step 2: Stop and backup the currently running container

Stop the currently running container using the command

```bash
$ docker stop redis
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose stop redis
```

Next, take a snapshot of the persistent volume `/path/to/redis-persistence` using:

```bash
$ rsync -a /path/to/redis-persistence /path/to/redis-persistence.bkp.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H.%M.%S)
```

### Step 3: Remove the currently running container

```bash
$ docker rm -v redis
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose rm -v redis
```

### Step 4: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```bash
$ docker run --name redis bitnami/redis-sentinel:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose up redis
```

# Notable Changes

## 4.0.10-r25

- The Redis sentinel container has been migrated to a non-root container approach. Previously the container run as `root` user and the redis daemon was started as `redis` user. From now own, both the container and the redis daemon run as user `1001`. As a consequence, the configuration files are writable by the user running the redis process. You can revert this behavior by changing `USER 1001` to `USER root` in the Dockerfile.
